# COVID-19Resnet18Classifier
I used PyTorch Along Pre-Trained Resnet18 and then trained it on the Database, Which Resulted in validation accuracy of 95% and loss of .16

The dataset that I used was - https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
This dataset might have been changed. So appropriate changes shoul be made
